# EduChain Registration Flow - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete user registration flow that distinguishes between students and scholarship providers, with email verification and role-based UI.

## Flow Architecture

### 1. Landing Page (`/`)
- User clicks "Get Started Now" button
- Routes to `/details` (registration page)

### 2. Details Page (`/details`)
- **Step 1: Role Selection**
  - User chooses between "Student" or "Scholarship Provider"
  - Visual cards with icons and descriptions
  
- **Step 2: Registration Form**
  - **Student Form:**
    - Full Name *
    - College Email *
    - Institute/University *
    - Program/Major *
    - Expected Graduation Year *
    - Supporting Document (optional)
    - Wallet Address (auto-filled)
  
  - **Provider Form:**
    - Organization Name *
    - Work Email *
    - Website
    - Contact Person *
    - Organization Description *
    - Verification Document (optional)
    - Wallet Address (auto-filled)

- **Step 3: Submission**
  - Data sent to backend API
  - User role stored in localStorage
  - Email verification sent
  - Redirect to `/Home` page

### 3. Home Page (`/Home`)
- **Role-Based Navigation:**
  - **Provider:**
    - "Create Pool" button
    - "My Pools" button
  
  - **Student:**
    - "My Applications" button
  
  - **No Role (Not Registered):**
    - "Complete Registration" button
    - Registration prompt banner

- **Role-Based Content:**
  - **Provider:** "Scholarship Pool Management"
  - **Student:** "Available Scholarship Pools"
  - **No Role:** "Explore Scholarship Opportunities" + registration prompt

- **Features:**
  - Search pools by name/organization
  - Filter by status (All/Open/Closed)
  - View pool statistics
  - Browse scholarship pool cards
  - Click to view pool details

## Backend Implementation

### New Models
**User Model** (`backend/models/User.js`)
- `walletAddress` - Unique wallet identifier
- `role` - "student" or "provider"
- `email` - User email for verification
- `emailVerified` - Boolean flag
- `verificationToken` - Email verification token
- `studentData` - Student-specific fields (name, institute, etc.)
- `providerData` - Provider-specific fields (org name, description, etc.)

### New Routes
**Onboarding Routes** (`backend/routes/onboardingRoutes.js`)
- `POST /api/onboarding/student` - Register student
- `POST /api/onboarding/provider` - Register provider
- `GET /api/onboarding/verify/:token` - Verify email
- `POST /api/onboarding/resend-verification` - Resend verification email
- `GET /api/onboarding/profile/:walletAddress` - Get user profile

### New Controller
**Onboarding Controller** (`backend/controllers/onboardingController.js`)
- `registerStudent()` - Handle student registration with IPFS upload
- `registerProvider()` - Handle provider registration with IPFS upload
- `verifyEmail()` - Email verification logic
- `resendVerification()` - Resend verification email
- `getUserProfile()` - Fetch user data by wallet address

## Data Flow

### Registration Flow
1. User selects role â†’ `setStep('student'/'provider')`
2. User fills form â†’ `studentForm/providerForm` state
3. User uploads document (optional) â†’ File stored in state
4. Submit â†’ FormData created with all fields
5. POST to backend â†’ `/api/onboarding/student` or `/provider`
6. Backend validates â†’ Check duplicates, upload to IPFS
7. Backend creates User â†’ Store in MongoDB
8. Backend sends email â†’ Verification token email
9. Backend responds â†’ Success message
10. Frontend stores role â†’ `localStorage.setItem('userRole', role)`
11. Redirect to Home â†’ `router.push('/Home')`

### Home Page Load Flow
1. Check wallet connection â†’ `window.ethereum`
2. Load user role â†’ `localStorage.getItem('userRole')`
3. Render navigation â†’ Based on role
4. Render content â†’ Based on role
5. Fetch pools â†’ From blockchain (mock data currently)

## Security Features
- Rate limiting (5 requests/minute on onboarding)
- File type validation (PDF, PNG, JPG only)
- File size limit (5MB max)
- Email uniqueness check
- Wallet address uniqueness check
- Token expiry (24 hours)
- Secure token generation (32-byte random hex)

## User Experience
- Smooth multi-step flow
- Clear role differentiation
- Visual feedback during submission
- Error handling with alerts
- Optional document uploads
- Auto-filled wallet addresses
- Registration reminders on Home page
- Consistent glassmorphism UI design
- Animated backgrounds (Threads component)

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy Smart Contracts** - Deploy PoolFactory and ScholarshipPool to testnet
2. **Integrate Blockchain** - Replace mock pool data with actual contract calls
3. **Create Pool Page** - Build form for providers to create pools
4. **Pool Details Page** - Show full pool info and application form
5. **My Applications Page** - Student dashboard for tracking applications
6. **My Pools Page** - Provider dashboard for managing pools
7. **Admin Verification** - System for verifying provider accounts
8. **Email Templates** - Design HTML email templates
9. **Testing** - End-to-end testing of registration flow
10. **Error Handling** - Improve error messages and UI feedback
