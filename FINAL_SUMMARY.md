## 🚀 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### **Step 1: Deploy Smart Contracts** ⏳

```bash
cd contracts

# 1. Add your private key to .env
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# 2. Get test tokens
# Mumbai: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
# Sepolia: https://sepoliafaucet.com/

# 3. Deploy
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com \
  --broadcast \
  --legacy \
  -vvvv

# 4. SAVE THE ADDRESS!
# Output will show: "PoolFactory deployed to: 0xYOUR_ADDRESS"
```

### **Step 2: Update Configuration Files** ⏳

```typescript
// frontend/lib/contracts.ts
export const POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS = "0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS";
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  chainId: 80001,
  chainName: "Polygon Mumbai",
  rpcUrl: "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com",
  blockExplorer: "https://mumbai.polygonscan.com"
};
```

```bash
# backend/.env
RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
POOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS
KWALA_API_SECRET=generate_a_random_secret_here_abc123xyz
BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL=https://mumbai.polygonscan.com
```

### **Step 3: Test Your Application Locally** ⏳

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Register as Provider
2. Create a test pool
3. Fund the pool with test MATIC
4. Register as Student
5. Submit an application
6. Manually test the flow works

### **Step 4: Set Up Kwala** ⏳

1. **Create Kwala Account**:
   - Go to https://kwala.network/
   - Sign up (free)
   - Get your Kwala automation wallet address

2. **Fund Kwala Wallet**:
   - Send 0.1 test MATIC to Kwala's wallet
   - This pays for automation gas fees

3. **Grant AUTOMATION_ROLE to Kwala**:
   ```javascript
   // In your frontend console or Remix:
   const poolAddress = "0xYOUR_POOL_ADDRESS";
   const kwalaWallet = "0xKWALA_WALLET_ADDRESS";
   
   const pool = new ethers.Contract(poolAddress, POOL_ABI, signer);
   const AUTOMATION_ROLE = await pool.AUTOMATION_ROLE();
   
   // Grant the role
   const tx = await pool.grantRole(AUTOMATION_ROLE, kwalaWallet);
   await tx.wait();
   
   console.log("✅ Kwala granted AUTOMATION_ROLE!");
   ```

4. **Upload Workflows to Kwala Dashboard**:
   - Open `kwala-workflows/1-auto-review-workflow.yaml`
   - Update ALL placeholders:
     - `0xYOUR_SCHOLARSHIP_POOL_ADDRESS_HERE`
     - `https://your-backend.render.com`
     - `YOUR_KWALA_API_SECRET`
     - `ChainID` (80001 for Mumbai)
   - Upload to Kwala dashboard
   - Repeat for workflow #2

### **Step 5: Deploy Backend to Production** ⏳

Deploy to Render.com or similar:

```bash
# On Render.com:
1. Connect your GitHub repo
2. Select "backend" folder as root
3. Add environment variables from backend/.env
4. Deploy!

# Your backend URL will be something like:
https://educhain-backend.onrender.com
```

Update Kwala workflows with this URL.

### **Step 6: Test Automation End-to-End** ⏳

1. **Test Auto-Review**:
   - Submit application as student
   - Check Kwala dashboard - should see workflow triggered
   - Check blockchain - application should be approved
   - Check email - student should receive approval

2. **Test Auto-Payroll** (temporary):
   - Change workflow #2 cron to `* * * * *` (every minute)
   - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - Check blockchain - student should be paid
   - Change cron back to `0 17 * * 5` (Fridays)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Kwala workflow not triggering | Check contract address, verify event ABI |
| "Missing role" error | Run `grantRole(AUTOMATION_ROLE, kwalaWallet)` |
| Backend 401 Unauthorized | Check `KWALA_API_SECRET` matches in both places |
| Student not getting email | Check User model, verify `isEmailVerified: true` |
| Payment fails | Check pool has funds, Kwala wallet has gas |
| IPFS fetch fails | Check `IPFS_PROJECT_ID` and `IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET` |

## 🎬 Demo Script (60 seconds)

**Problem** (10s): "Scholarship providers waste hours manually reviewing applications and paying students one by one."

**Solution** (15s): "EduChain automates everything. Providers create a pool, fund it, and walk away. Our system handles approval and payments automatically using Kwala."

**Live Demo** (25s):
1. "Watch: Student submits application..."
2. "Kwala instantly reviews criteria..."
3. "Auto-approves and notifies student..."
4. "Every Friday, batch payments go out..."
5. "All without provider touching anything."

**Impact** (10s): "Result: Providers save 10+ hours per week. Students get instant responses. Zero manual work. That's EduChain."
